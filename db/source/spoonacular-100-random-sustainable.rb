A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.",

            "description": "Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Prophecy Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

        "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chloe Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

        "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tiamo Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Prophecy Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

        "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tiamo Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Maso Canali Pinot Grigio.

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Prophecy Pinot Grigio. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Prophecy Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chloe Pinot Grigio.

      "instructions": "Fill up a large bowl halfway with water and squeeze the juice of 1 lemon in it. Set aside.Prepare the artichokes by taking away the outer leaves. You can do this by holding the tip of each leaf and snapping downwards. Do this until you arrive to the heart of the artichoke. With a paring knife, trim off the base evenly including the stem. Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chateau Ste.

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

        "pairingText": "Fish can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

        "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

        "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

Fresh and fragrant with bright aromas of pineapple, white peach, and tropical fruit accompanied by delicate white flowers and sage, followed by flavors of apple and pear.

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

        "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tramin Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Pinot Gris with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chloe Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The La Fiera Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio.

You can do this by holding the tip of each leaf and snapping downwards. Do this until you arrive to the heart of the artichoke. With a paring knife, trim off the base evenly including the stem. Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio.

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Loveblock Pinot Gris. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The La Fiera Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 7 dollars per bottle.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Loveblock Pinot Gris with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

        "pairingText": "Fish can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Prophecy Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Prophecy Pinot Grigio.

Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chloe Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try La Fiera Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 7 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tramin Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Prophecy Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Prophecy Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Maso Canali Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.",

        "pairingText": "Fish can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips.

Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The La Fiera Pinot Grigio with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 7 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Loveblock Pinot Gris with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.",

Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Prophecy Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 10 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Prophecy Pinot Grigio. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.",

To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon.

Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tramin Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is La Fiera Pinot Grigio. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 7 dollars.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maso Canali Pinot Grigio.

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.",

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.",

Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Loveblock Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Loveblock Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

        "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.",

            "description": "Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips.

Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tramin Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "MethodIts worth trying to get hold of saffron for this one  its available from most delis and good supermarkets. Its not cheap, but bear in mind you wont need much at all to spice up a dish. Make sure you use a wide pan so all the fish is in contact with the tomatoey broth. If you havent got one, try using a high-sided roasting tray instead, with another tray as a lid.To make the saffron aoli, smash a clove of garlic, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and the saffron (if using) with a small pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker until it turns into a mush. Add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and pound again. Stir in the rest of the mayo. Taste and season with a little more lemon juice, salt and pepper.Give the mussels and clams a good wash in plenty of clean cold water and scrub any dirty ones lightly with a scrubbing brush, pulling off any beardy bits. If there are any that arent tightly closed, give them a sharp tap. If they dont close up, throw them away. Heat a large, wide saucepan or stewing pot and pour in a splash of olive oil. Slice up the rest of the garlic and fry it in the oil until lightly golden. Add the wine and the tomatoes and the basil stalks and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has reduced a little.Add all your fish and shellfish in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Push the fish down into the liquid and put the lid on. Cook gently for about 10 minutes or until all the clams and mussels have opened and the fish fillets and langoustines or prawns are cooked through. (Discard any clams or mussels that dont open.)Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan and get out the serving bowls. Put a piece of toast in each bowl and ladle the soup over the top, making sure the fish is divided more or less evenly. Top each bowl with some fennel tops, basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a big blob of saffron aoli.Tip",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips. To avoid turning brown, put all the artichokes in the bowl of water with lemon. Drain the artichokes when ready to use.Over medium heat, in a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil, sauté the garlic. When the garlic turns golden, add the drained artichokes. Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.",

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat. Lift the wrappings on which the fish rests and transfer to a platter. Serve hot with rice. No dipping sauce required.",

Slice off the top. Insert the knife to the core and scoop out the middle part and the hairs. Slice the artichokes to strips.

Toss in the oil for 5 minutes.Pour 1/2 cup of white wine and let the alcohol evaporate.Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon. Season with salt & pepper.Cover and simmer on low fire for 15 minutes or until the artichokes are tender.When they are cooked, transfer them to a plate and set aside.Over medium heat, using the same saucepan, add more extra virgin olive oil.Brown both sides of the fish.Pour the remaining 1 cup of wine. Let it evaporate.When the sauce becomes slightly thick, season with salt & pepper.Put back the artichokes, cover and simmer for another 5 minutes.Sprinkle the parsley then turn off the fire.Drizzle with fresh extra virgin olive oil before serving.",
